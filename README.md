## Career Help App
This app would be an implementation of the Resume analyzer and career coach apps features (originally implemented with Flask) combined with Django.

Django is a very roboust framework and its mmodular nature makes it easy to have many features combined into a single app

## Features
This new app would contain the previous functioning of both apps new and improved (Resume fixing, career path guidiance) also with a new application tracking dashboard to help in tracking applications.

Resumes would be able to be matched with job descriptions even by just pasting the link
There would also be a resume bullet point formatter as well
